# password-compare
Simple script for password comparison


Takes two windows password files, filter out the passwords and usernames and creates a new file with all users that use the same password.
That list can then be used for enforcing better password management from users and to motivate more strict password policies


ToDo:

Can probably use normal improvements.
Change the files from incode to inline arguments, making it alot more user friendly
Error management
Better reporting
